## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a critical task for businesses aiming to understand their customers better. This project focuses on dividing customers into distinct groups based on specific characteristics or behaviors. This segmentation can help companies tailor their marketing, product development, and customer service strategies to better meet the needs of each customer group.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create a customer segmentation model that will allow businesses to:

- Identify different customer groups with similar attributes.
- Understand the unique characteristics and needs of each customer segment.
- Customize marketing efforts to target each segment more effectively.
- Improve customer retention and satisfaction.

## Methods

We employ the following techniques and methodologies to perform customer segmentation:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data from various sources, which may include customer profiles, transaction history, demographic information, and online behavior.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, transform, and normalize the data to make it suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values and outliers.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract and create meaningful features from the data, such as RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores, customer lifetime value, and others.

4. **Segmentation Algorithms**: Apply clustering algorithms, such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN, to group customers with similar characteristics together.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the quality of the segmentation using metrics like silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, or domain-specific criteria.

6. **Visualization**: Visualize the customer segments to provide actionable insights and assist in decision-making.

7. **Interpretation**: Interpret the results and generate recommendations for targeted marketing and product strategies.

## Data Sources

The project was sourced from Kaggle
